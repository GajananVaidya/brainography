                Passion is a strong desire that can get you to do amazing things. A desire fuelled by Passion can bring about 
            the greatest results in your life. Passion activates your determination, conviction, and love. The secret to living 
            your dream is hidden in your Passion and how do you react with it.
            
            <p>
                Finding what you are passionate about is a journey in itself.
            Don't be frustrated if you don't feel like you know yet. Keep trying new things. Once you discover the emotion of Passion,
            act upon it. Without action, Passion yields no fruitful results. When you pursue your Passion, you will find yourself tripped
            up by failures and other obstacles. It happens to everyone on the path of following their Passion. Don't let obstacles get you down.
