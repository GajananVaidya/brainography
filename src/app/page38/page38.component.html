                            Gross Motor Skills (GMS) is the co-ordination of large muscular movements of the body in
                            synchronization with the thought process. People with high GMS are very swift in moving and
                            performing action. They are very active physically as well as mentally. They tend to be
                            pro-active towards kinesthetic challenges which involve physical action. They are
                            experienced based learners and understand better by exploring pragmatically.
