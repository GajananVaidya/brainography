                            3D Imagination (Spatial Intelligence) is application of mental skill to imagine and
                            picturize objects, faces or scenes in a non-visual way (like a video). In other words, the
                            ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Persons with high Spatial Intelligence can Plan,
                            Project, Conceive, Rotate & even manipulate almost anything in their Imagination. They can
                            navigate with the sense of Speed, Velocity, Force and direction from multiple angles in
                            their mind. They also have a huge memory to store Astronomical amount of Data for
                            interminable period of time.
